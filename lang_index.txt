Language Popularity Index
-------------------------
The package Lang_Index provides a fully automatic gathering of data
using various search engines (see e.csv) about various programming
languages (see l.csv). All details are configured and explained
in search.xls which contains the sheets for e.csv and l.csv.

Simply said, Lang_Index.Generate does the following tasks:
1) gather result counts for each pair {language, engine}
2) apply to them a given confidence factor per language
3) establish one language market share list per search engine
4) establish a market share list, averaged over the search engines,
     using given weights
5) establish one conditional market share list per language category

Results of steps 1) to 4) appear from left to right in the detailed
HTML table (HTML_details); results of step 5) appear in HTML_table_categ.
